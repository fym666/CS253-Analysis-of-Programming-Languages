(Same as the "Week 9" section in the README.md file of the parent directory.)
- Due to environment issue (no numpy) it cannot run on this Repl. Please go to the URL that I submitted to run week9.py or this link: https://replit.com/@Carving/CS253-Week9#Week9/README.md
# Week 9
Go to folder Week9.
```
cd Week9
```
Compile and run the exercise in array programming style with:
```
python3 week9.py ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
```
- The output result would be:
```
07 +#3  -  491
+0 83  -  445
!И +#3  -  397
мЯ D4Я<￥  -  273
+0 +#3  -  268
```
According to my version of Leet mapping provided in the code, the output is a transform of:
```
OF THE  -  491
TO BE  -  445
IN THE  -  397
MR DARCY  -  273
TO THE  -  268 
```
- Please see comments in code for specific requirements in this exercise, I've implemented them strictly within constraints.
- The output of running *week9.py* is saved in *output-w9.txt* correspondingly.
- The proof that the program ran successfully and obtained the correct output has been saved in the log file *week_9.log* under the directory *Week9*.
