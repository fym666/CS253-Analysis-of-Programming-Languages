(Same as the "Week 8" section in the README.md file located at the parent directory.)
# Week 8
Go to folder Week8.
```
cd Week8
```
1. Compile and run exercise 29.1 with:
```
javac TwentyNine.java 
java TwentyNine ../pride-and-prejudice.txt 
```
2. Compile and run exercise 30.1 with:
```
javac Thirty.java
java Thirty ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
```
3. Compile and run exercises 32.1+32.3 with:
```
javac ThirtyTwo.java
java ThirtyTwo ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
```
- Please see comments in code for specific requirements in exercise 32.1/3, I've implemented them strictly within constraints.

Overall:
- The outputs of running *TwentyNine.java*, *Thirty.java*, *ThirtyTwo.java* are saved in *output29.txt*, *output30.txt*, *output32.txt* correspondingly.
- The proof that the program ran successfully and obtained the correct output has been saved in the log file *week_8.log* under the directory *Week8*.
